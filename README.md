# nativefier
Nativefier is a command-line tool to easily create a desktop app for any web site with minimal configuration. Apps are wrapped by Electron (which uses Chromium under the hood) in an OS executable (.app, .exe, etc) for use on Windows, macOS and Linux.  I did this because I was tired of having to âŒ˜-tab or alt-tab to my browser and then search through the numerous open tabs when I was using Facebook Messenger or Whatsapp Web (HN thread). Nativefier features:  Automatically retrieval of app icon / name. JavaScript and CSS injection. Many more, see the API docs or nativefier --help
